The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a global pandemic and led to more than a million deaths todate. COVID-19  early  detection  is  essential  for  its  mitigation  by  controlling  its  spread  from  infectedpatients  in  communities  through  quarantine.   Although  vaccination  has  started,  it  will  take  time  toreach everyone, especially in developing nations, and computer scientists are striving to come up withcompetent  methods  using  image  analysis. In this work we use three CNN models trained from scratch to detect Covid-19 patients from chest Xray images. THe predictions from the three models are then combined using Sugeno fuzzy integral method and Choquet fuzzy integral method. For using the fuzzy integral based ensemble methods we have to determine the fuzzy measure values. For this we have used Optimization algorithms on the validation dataset to get the highest accuracy score by varying the values of the fuzzy measure values.
