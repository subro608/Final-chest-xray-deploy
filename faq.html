			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Introduction</b></p>
			
			<p>This is a project based on chest xray classifcation into three cases Covid-19, Pneumonia and Normal cases. For this purpose I have used three classifier models for this which are trained from scratch.</p>
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>First Classifier</b></p>
			
			<p>The first classifier is built using multiple convolutional layers which takes in a 3-channel RGB image to give the predictions.</p>
    
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Second Classifier</b></p>
			
			<p>The second classifier is built using 4 convolutional layers.</p>
    
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Third Classifier</b></p>
			
			<p>The third classifier only considers the red channel of the input image to give the prediction scores.</p>
			
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Sugeno Integral based Ensemble</b></p>
			
			<p>In the case of a fuzzy inference system, output values are calculated based on some fuzzy rules andinput variables. These rules can be interpreted into two ways which are known as conjunctive rules anddisjunctive rules. Weighted maximum is a way of interpreting fuzzy inference rules in the conjunctivemanner, and weighted minimum is one way of interpreting fuzzy inference rules in a disjunctive manner.These  two  interpretations  of  fuzzy  inference  rules  are  unified  by  the  Sugeno  integral  method  usingweighted  maximum  and  weighted  minimum.  Here,  one  important  aspect  of  the  weighted  maximumand  the  weighted  minimum  used  by  Sugeno  integral  is  that  the  weighting  vector  does  not  belong  toany probability distribution, which means that the sum of the weights does not equal to 1. Hence, theaggregation operator that uses these weights does not satisfy the unanimity. Also, in the case of weightedmaximum and the weighted minimum, the values that need to be aggregated are independent of eachother which is not the case in the Sugeno integral method. So it can be said that the Sugeno integralcombines the conclusions from the different fuzzy inference rules, where the rules are not independent.As the weights are not probabilistic and need to be determined experimentally, so in order to apply theSugeno integral method to combine the predictions from three base learners, we have used optimization algorithms to get optimal fuzzy measures.</p>	
    
  		<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Choquet Integral based Ensemble</b></p>
			
			<p>Aggregation refers to the process of collecting performance scores of each classifier into a single global score.  The function that is used to combine the scores into a single global score is known as aggregation operator.Normally  as  the  aggregation  operator,  we  have  weighted  average  or  quasi  arithmetic  means  butin  our  case  it  is  the  Choquet  fuzzy  integral  operator.   The  Choquet  fuzzy  integral  method  has  been used previously in many pattern recognition problems.  The advantage of using it is thatit  harnesses  the  degree  of  uncertainty  that  is  present  in  the  decision  scores  that  we  get  as  additionalinformation during the fusion of classifiers which is absent in normal ensembling methods.  So the endresult is the generalization of aggregation operators on a set of confidence scores which are known asfuzzy measures.  These fuzzy measures are determined using the optimization algorithms.</p>
