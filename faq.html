			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Introduction</b></p>
			
			<p>This is a project based on chest xray classifcation into three cases Covid-19, Pneumonia and Normal cases. For this purpose I have used three classifier models for this which are trained from scratch.</p>
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>First Classifier</b></p>
			
			<p>The first classifier is built using multiple convolutional layers which takes in a 3-channel RGB image to give the predictions.</p>
    
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Second Classifier</b></p>
			
			<p>The second classifier is also built using multiple convolutional layers, first Prewitt edge detection is used to detect the edges and then the edge map is concatenated with the original input image. So this classifier takes in a 4-channel image.</p>
    
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Third Classifier</b></p>
			
			<p>The third classifier only considers the red channel of the input image to give the prediction scores.</p>
			
		

			
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Limitations</b></p>
			
			<p>This project can be expanded to cover many more lung diseases.</p>
			
			<p>The accuracy can be improved using state-of-the-art ensemble methods.</p>
			

			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Published Design</b></p>
			
			<p>The design code and the step-by-step process used to train and test the model has been published on Kaggle. You can find the open source notebook <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/child-pneumonia-diagnoser-tensorflow-js-web-app/notebook" target='_blank' class="w3-text-blue">here</a>. The test results are also available in the notebook.</p>
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-pink topp-margin'><b>Dataset Licence</b></p>
			
			<p>The model was trained using image <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia" target='_blank' class="w3-text-blue">data</a> that was released under a CC BY 4.0 licence.</p>

			</div>
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>Will I need to wait for the model to download every time I use the app?</b></p>
			
			<p>No. Once the model downloads it will be cached in memory. The next time you visit this site you won’t need to wait.</p>
			
			<p>That said, I suggest that you always use this tool with your web browser set to incognito mode. The model won’t be saved, but this will ensure that each time you visit this site you will always use the most up to date version of the model and not the old one that's stored in your device's memory.
			</p>
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>What about patient data privacy?</b></p>
			
			<p>Your images are never sent to an external server. Any image you submit stays on your computer or mobile phone. This is because the model is running on your device. This is also why a batch of images can be analyzed in less than two seconds.</p>
			
			<p>In return for a short wait while the model downloads you get data privacy and fast processing.
				The tech that makes this possible is called Tensorflow.js. It was created by Google.</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>What do the decimal numbers mean?</b></p>
			
			<p>They are probability scores between 0 and 1. They show how confident the model is that a particular condition is present on the image. <br>
				For example, <i>Viral Pneumonia: 0.751</i> means that the model is 75% sure that viral pneumonia is present on the x-ray.</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>How do I use this app on a computer?
			</b></p>
			
			<p>- Go to this site on your computer.<br>
				- Click the orange button.<br>
			- Select one image or multiple images and click ‘Open’.<br>
			- The app will print results for each image.
			</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>How do I use this app on a mobile phone?
			</b></p>
			
			<p>You can take a new photo or you can submit photos that are stored on your phone. The steps below apply to Android. iOS may be similar but I'm not sure.</p>
			
			<p class="w3-text-pink"><b>[ 1 ] Take a photo</b></p>
			<p>- Go to this site on your phone.<br>
			- Tap the orange button.<br>
			- Select “Camera”<br>
			- Take a photo<br>
			- Tap the "tick"<br>
			- The photo will be sent to the app for analysis.
			</p>
			
			
			<p class="w3-text-pink"><b>[ 2 ] Use images from your photo folder</b></p>
			<p>- Go to this site on your phone.<br>
				- Tap the orange button.<br>
				- Tap "Files"<br>
				- Tap the image name<br>
				- To submit a batch of images, tap each image (tick) to select it and then tap "Open". 
			</p>
			
			
			
				
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b> What would it take to make this tool more accurate?</b></p>
			
			<p>Two things are needed - more high quality labeled training data and field testing.</p>
			
		
				
				
				
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>Where can I send feedback or report bugs?</b></p>
			
			<p>Please feel free to email your thoughts or ideas to:<br>
